    <dao-card id="🃝" data-suit="♣" data-rank="Q" data-title="Oracle">
      <p slot="description">An information source that provides external data to smart contracts. They bridge the gap
        between on-chain and off-chain systems, enabling smart contracts to access data from the real world. Since
        smart contracts are designed to be deterministic and self-executing, they cannot access external data
        directly. Oracles solve this problem by acting as intermediaries, feeding verified data to smart contracts,
        which is essential for various use cases like financial services, supply chain management, and prediction
        markets. Oracles can be classified into several types, including software oracles (accessing online data
        sources), hardware oracles (interacting with physical devices), and human oracles (relying on human input).
        They can also be centralized or decentralized, with the latter offering higher levels of trust and security.

  <h4>About these cards:</h4>
  <h5>In June 2023, DAOcraft ran a workshop about Funding The Commons using these cards.</h5>
  <p>
    Welcome to your new deck of playing cards. Each unique card represents a cryptoeconomic primitive. Locate each
    card
    by filtering for its rank and suit. Click on a card to reveal the definition of its primitive. Visit the gallery
    to
    browse the entire deck.
